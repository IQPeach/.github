## What we build

We help education organizations turn ideas into **clear, usable learning experiences**—without overcomplicating the tools.

- **School-ready platforms** (portals, dashboards, program hubs)
- **Digital learning tools** (mini-apps, trackers, checklists, micro-tools)
- **Curriculum & content systems** (templates, structure, navigation — *not lesson writing*)
- **LMS setup & integration** (Canvas, Blackboard, Moodle, Google Classroom, Schoology)
- **Assessment & reporting tools** (quizzes, progress tracking, dashboards, exports)
- **Custom educational products** (simulations, utilities, instructional tools)

---

## How we work

1. **Tell us your needs**  
   Share goals, constraints, and the learning problem you want to solve.
2. **We build your learning technology**  
   We design and develop the platform/tool/integration around how your team actually works.
3. **You launch with confidence**  
   You get something scalable, user-friendly, and ready for real-world use.

## Who we build for

- Schools, districts, and higher ed teams  
- Nonprofits and community programs  
- Education companies, tutoring programs, and training teams  
- Individual creators who want clean, structured learning experiences

## What you’ll find on our GitHub

This org is where we share **practical building blocks** from our work in learning tech, such as:

- Reference implementations and starter projects
- UI components and patterns for learning tools
- LMS integration examples (LTI, embeds, APIs)
- Templates for consistent course/content structure
- Utilities for reporting, dashboards, and content delivery

> Some repositories may be internal or client-specific—public projects will be clearly labeled and documented.

## In progress

We’re also developing **IQPeach Course Builder** — a course “workbench” layer that helps teams design consistent course patterns and connect them back into an LMS.

---

## Tech we use

Modern web stacks and learning standards, including:

- JavaScript, React, Node.js, Next.js
- AWS, Firebase
- SQL / NoSQL data stores
